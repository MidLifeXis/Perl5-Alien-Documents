Contributing to Perl5-Alien
=====================

Perl5-Alien is a development organization devoted to the continued development of Alien::Base and the Perl 5 Alien ecosystem as a whole.
It consists of a pumkin-holder (currently Joel Berger) and the core developer team listed in the github organization, currently they are

* Chris Marshall (chm)
* Brian Wightman (MidLifeXis)

The rules of the organization are as follows:

* The addition and modification of features is decided by majority vote or the pumpkin-holder.
* Any core developer may nominate a new one, who must then be accepted by a 2/3 majority vote.
* The pumpkin-holder has veto rights and may select their successor.
* A feature is only needed when the majority of the user base benefits from it.
* Features may only be changed or removed in a major release.
* Refactoring and deprecations should be avoided if no important feature depends on it.
* New features can be marked as experimental to be excluded from deprecation policies.
* A major release is signaled by a new major version number and a unique code name based on a Unicode character.
* Only add dependencies if absolutely necessary and make them optional if possible.
* The master source code repository should always be kept in a stable state, use feature branches for actual development.
* All code contributions from non-core members should be sent as GitHub pull requests.
* No Elitism.
* Peace!
